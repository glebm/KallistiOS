    \brief   Interrupt and exception handling.
    \ingroup irqs

    This file contains various definitions and declarations related to handling
    interrupts and exceptions on the Dreamcast. This level deals with IRQs and
    exceptions generated on the SH4, versus the asic layer which deals with
    actually differentiating "external" interrupts.

    \see    dc/asic.h, arch/trap.h

    \todo
        - Save and restore SH4 DBR register in irq_context_t.
        - Add support for `EXPMASK` (assuming DC's SH4 supports it).
        - Stop including trap.h from irq.h.
        - Explicitly label unimplemented interrupts for DC with separate type

    This is an API for managing interrupts, their masks, and their
    handler routines along with thread context information.

    \warning
    This is a low-level, internal kernel API. Many of these
    interrupts are utilized by various KOS drivers and have higher-level APIs
    for hooking into them. Care must be taken to not interfere with the IRQ
    handling which is being done by in-use KOS drivers. It is often better to
    install a global filter to observe interrupt events passively than it is
    to override individual interrupt handlers which have been used by the
    system.

/** \defgroup irq_handlers  Handlers
    \brief                  API for managing IRQ handlers

    This API provides a series of methods for registering and retrieving
    different types of exception handlers.

    KOS's low-level IRQ dispatcher provides an extremely flexible interrupt
    handler chain with multiple ways to filter, accept, or reject a particular
    exception event.

    The interrupt handler chain provided by the dispatcher propagates
    unhandled exceptions to handlers in the following order:

        global handler -> specific handler -> unhandled exception handler

    Each step in the chain is free to either accept and terminate the
    exception, or ignore and reject it, causing the dispatcher to propagate
    it on to the next handler in the chain. Finally, the kernel will panic
    and abort if the exception made it through the chain without ever being
    handled.

    This exception propagation and handler dispatch mechanism provides for
    the following features:
        - <b>Conditional Exception Handling</b>: Any handler is free to
          determine whether to accept or ignore the exception at runtime.
        - <b>Exception Filtering</b>: Any handler is free to intercept an
          exception and mark it as handled before it propagates onwards.
        - <b>Exception Observing</b>: Any handler is free to simply "observe"
          the exception to log an event or do passive processing by not
          handling it and allowing it to propagate onwards.
        - <b>Multiple Exception Handling</b>: Using either global or unhandled
          exception handlers or by installing the same handler on multiple
          specific handlers, a single handler is free to implement logic
          for servicing multiple interrupts.

    \note
    The only exception to this rule is the \ref EXC_DOUBLE_FAULT software
    exception which is the only handler that fires in the case of an exception
    being raised while already in an interrupt handling an exception. If this
    handler does not handle the exception, the kernel panics and aborts.

/** \defgroup irq_handlers_ind  Individual 
    \brief                      API for managing individual IRQ handlers.

    This API is for managing handlers installed to handle individual IRQ codes.

    With the exception of \ref EXC_DOUBLE_FAULT, which is always called first,
    these individual exception handlers will be called \i after the global
    handler runs, assuming it does not accept the IRQ event. Finally, assuming
    an individual handler doesn't handle the event, the handler for
    \ref EXC_UNHANDLED_EXC will be called as a last effort to handle the
    exception.

    \note
    Any handler installed to handle any IRQ code type other than the
    `SOFT` type (\ref EXC_DOUBLE_FAULT and \ref EXC_UNHANDLED_EXC codes) is
    expected to have handled the given exception by default. If you wish to
    reject the exception or tell the dispatcher that it should remain
    unhandled, use irq_handle_int() with `FALSE`.

    \note
    The two `SOFT` type IRQs (\ref EXC_DOUBLE_FAULT and \ref EXC_UNHANDLED_EXC
    codes) are expected not to handle their exceptions by default, causing the
    system to panic and abort. If you wish to signal to the dispatcher that
    your handler has gracefully recovered from these exceptions, use
    irq_handle_int() with `TRUE` to signal that the exception was handled.

/** Set a global exception handler.

    This function sets a global catch-all filter for all exception types.

    The global exception handler is called first for normal exception
    scenarios, giving it a chance to handle the exception request before it
    arrives at an individual-level handler. The exception to the rule is for
    when an exception is raised while already in an exception handler, in which
    case only the individual handler installed for \ref EXC_DOUBLE_FAULT will
    be called.

    \param  data            A pointer that will be passed along to the callback.
