    \brief     API for the Dreamcast's system calls
    \ingroup   system

    This module encapsulates all the system calls available in the Dreamcast 
    BIOS, allowing direct interaction with system hardware 
    components such as the GDROM drive, flash ROM, and bios fonts. These 
    functions are essential for performing low-level operations that are not
    handled by standard user-space APIs.
