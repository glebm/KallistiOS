/** \file    dc/pvr.h
    \brief   Low-level PVR (3D hardware) interface.
    \ingroup pvr

    This file provides support for using the PVR 3D hardware in the Dreamcast.
    Note that this does not handle any sort of perspective transformations or
    anything of the like. This is just a very thin wrapper around the actual
    hardware support.

    \remark
    This file is used for pretty much everything related to the PVR, from memory
    management to actual primitive rendering.

    \todo 
        - Auxiliary accumulation buffer
        - RTT texture sizes
        - Multipass rendering
        - pvr_poly_ctx_t::specular2
            - specular enabled within modifier?
        - Missing fog mode
        - Global "Intensity" light mode?
        - PVR_MIPBIAS_0 
            - Does it exist? What happens if set to 0?
        - pvr_list_flush() implementation
        - pvr_vertbuf_written()
            - shouldn't this at least assert if you write to much? Error code?
        - pvr_vertbuf_remaining()
            - query for the amount of storage remaining in a vertex buffer?

/** \defgroup   pvr_scene_mgmt  Scene Submission
    \brief                      PowerVR API for submitting scene geometry
    \ingroup                    pvr

    This API is used to submit triangle strips to the PVR via the TA
    interface in the chip.

    An important side note about the PVR is that all primitive types
    must be submitted grouped together. If you have 10 polygons for each
    list type, then the PVR must receive them via the TA by list type,
    with a list delimiter in between.

    So there are two modes you can use here. The first mode allows you to
    submit data directly to the TA. Your data will be forwarded to the
    chip for processing as it is fed to the PVR module. If your data
    is easily sorted into the primitive types, then this is the fastest
    mode for submitting data.

    The second mode allows you to submit data via main-RAM vertex buffers,
    which will be queued until the proper primitive type is active. In this
    case, each piece of data is copied into the vertex buffer while the
    wrong list is activated, and when the proper list becomes activated,
    the data is all sent at once. Ideally this would be via DMA, right
    now it is by store queues. This has the advantage of allowing you to
    send data in any order and have the PVR functions resolve how it should
    get sent to the hardware, but it is slower.

    The nice thing is that any combination of these modes can be used. You
    can assign a vertex buffer for any list, and it will be used to hold the
    incoming vertex data until the proper list has come up. Or if the proper
    list is already up, the data will be submitted directly. So if most of
    your polygons are opaque, and you only have a couple of translucents,
    you can set a small buffer to gather translucent data and then it will
    get sent when you do a pvr_end_scene().

    \remark
    Thanks to Mikael Kalms for the idea for this API.

    \note
    Another somewhat subtle point that bears mentioning is that in the normal
    case (interrupts enabled) an interrupt handler will automatically take
    care of starting a frame rendering (after scene_finish()) and also
    flipping pages when appropriate.
